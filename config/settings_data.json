The device has new software and hardware components that increases Trezor&rsquo;s ability to add more coins with upcoming projects.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>The Model T has a new, faster processer and operating system. The USB-C connector is compatible with any computer or mobile device. The SD card slot can be used for data encryption, password management and upcoming offline transaction signing.
